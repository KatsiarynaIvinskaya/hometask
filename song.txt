Step out into the sun
Skies above they radiate me
Lift up, carry the love
Do you know?

That I've been out of my mind
This slow life I'm waiting for you
To swing me all of your line
Do you know?

What a way to wake up
Feelin' like I'm overexposed
I guess it's kind of messed up
That I just wanna keep myself closed

Nothing hurts like
Bein' blindsided by love
Nothing hurts like
Thinkin' I'm not good enough
